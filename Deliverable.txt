Due Date: April 25 at Noon. Late submissions may not be graded.

What to Submit:

1) Your report (in PDF format)
2) Code that can reproduce your final results for Challenge 1 and 2. This should be provided as a standalone .ipynb, .py, or zipped folder with multiple scripts. The code should train and test on 50 seeds from the testbed.
3) (Optional) Appendix with code snippets for other methods you explored.

Challenge 1 Submission Details:
- Report the average and standard deviation of the final training and evaluation results, using a minimum of 10 splits.

Challenge 2 Submission Details:
- If your method takes a long time to run, you can use a minimum of 5 seeds.
Ensure the code is easy to follow and reproducible, even if the setup is complex.
Report Guidelines:

Discuss the training and testing time of your methods compared to the baseline (e.g. "my method is 2x slower than the baseline").

For Challenge 2, include a 1 paragraph discussion on the complexity of implementing your final approach, such as challenges with hyperparameter tuning or external library requirements.

The report length should be approximately 3-10 pages (2 column, 11pt font), not including appendices.

The literature review should be 1 page per graduate student.
The literature review can cover related work that is slightly different from your final methods, if relevant.
Alternative Project Submission:

Follow the same general guidelines, with a clearly written report including literature review (at least 1 paper per grad student) and optional readable code snippets.
Report length should follow the 3-10 page guideline.
